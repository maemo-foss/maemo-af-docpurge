docpurge (1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't use shell globs to list the files to purge.  It might grow too
    large and cause wierd effects.  Fixes: NB#77023.  Thanks Grigori
    Timonen for pointing this out!

docpurge (1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use Build-Depends instead of Build-Depends-Indep for debhelper since
    it is required for the "clean" target.  Added compat file for
    debhelper; install into debian/docpurge instead of debian/tmp.
    (Thanks Lintian!)

docpurge (1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Do not include postinst, it is not good to remove files during
    installation since the maintainer scripts of other packages might fail
    when they don't find their files.  Added GPL statement to source.
    Switched from debmake to debhelper.
  * Fixes: NB#46705.
