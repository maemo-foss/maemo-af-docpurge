docpurge (1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Do not include postinst, it is not good to remove files during
    installation since the maintainer scripts of other packages might fail
    when they don't find their files.  Added GPL statement to source.
    Switched from debmake to debhelper.
  * Fixes: NB#46705.
