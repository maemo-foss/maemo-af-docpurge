This is docpurge.  Installing this package will add a hook to apt so
that all of {/,/opt/maemo/}usr/share/{doc,man,info} will be removed
after every invocation of dpkg (by apt).  It also includes the command
/usr/sbin/docpurge that can be called manually to perform the
cleaning.  In addition, /usr/sbin/docpurge is executed automatically
when the docpurge package is installed.
